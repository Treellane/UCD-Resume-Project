# UCD - Resume

## Recume project for the Code Institute
## The "Putting it all together" project.

Following the video guides to complile a Resume Website.

### Head Links
- Links to external Bootstrap and FontAwesome taken from BootStrapCDN.com
- Link to internal style.css file


#### Issues encountered
- Profile image only appeared 30px wide! 
    Video code didn't add the line "logo {min-width: 360px;} and the photo appeared correctly, 
    but i had to add this line of code to get the photo to appear in it's proper width!
    Without it, the photo only appears 30px wide!!! (Contacted TUTOR SUPPORT about this!)
 
    Haley (from Tutor support) noticed I had Bootsrap 4.1.3 - as that is what the link in the 
    video brought me to! But in the video is was 3.7.7 Bootsrap!
    

##### Variance from the Video Code
- My heaading, and the text within it, are a different colour (done to suit my photo colour better!)
